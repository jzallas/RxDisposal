A convenient 'garbage disposal' that can hook into an rx streams.

 * Eliminate `Disposable` maintenance
 * Keep up that beautiful rx chain
 * Remove a little boilerplate

Getting Started
---------------
##### Setup your `Disposal`
Pick a `Disposal` with the `Disposable` storage strategy that fits your needs best. Then, wrap it inside a `SubscriptionDisposal` for easier use in an rx chain:

```java
SubscriptionDisposal myDisposal = new SubscriptionDisposal(new CompositeDisposal());
```

##### Registering a `Disposable`
Now you can plug in your `SubscriptionDisposal` every time you call `subscribe(...)` to automatically capture and remember the last `Disposable` product in that chain.

```java
myObservable.map(a -> doStuff(a))
            .map(s -> doStuff2(s))
            .map(d -> doStuff3(d))
            .subscribe(myDisposal.wrap(f -> print(f)));
```

Disposing Manually
---------------
`SubscriptionDisposal` is still a `Disposal`. You can call `dispose()` on it and it will delegate that request to the `Disposal` strategy you initially provided.

```java
myDisposal.dispose();
```

Disposing Automatically
------------------
If you're using the [LifecycleAware](https://github.com/jzallas/LifecycleAware) library on Android, then you can also create `Disposal`s that automatically dispose for you. The only extra thing you need to do is decide when (what lifecycle hook) you want your `Disposal` to auto dispose.

```java
@LifecycleAware(Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE)
SubscriptionAutoDiposal autoDisposal = new SubscriptionAutoDisposal(myDisposal);

// this should automatically dispose in onPause(...) if you're using LifecycleAware correctly
myObservable.map(a -> doStuff(a))
            .subscribe(autoDisposal.wrap(b -> print(b)));
```

Samples
-------
You can find examples in the included [sample app](/sample-app).

Dependencies
------------
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.jzallas:rxdisposal:0.1.1'

    // if you want to use Automatic Disposal
    implementation 'com.jzallas:rxdisposal-lifecycleaware:0.1.1'
}
```
